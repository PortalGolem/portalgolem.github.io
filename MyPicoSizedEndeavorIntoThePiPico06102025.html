      <h1>My Pico Sized Endeavor Into The Pi Pico</h1>

        Two days ago I finally got my Rasberry pi pico 2 working. I bought two of them a week or so before that in addition to a pico 2 W and was waiting on some soldering equipment graciously provided by my grandparents. I was also having a bunch of issues compiling and such on my computer and I was rather busy with other things which left me with only dreams of getting my pico functioning soon.
        <br> <br>
It was probably just a missing driver or library but for some reason I couldn’t get my VS code installation I specifically installed to start working with the pico working. For some reason it seemed unable to detect the project files and compile properly. After a few hours fiddling around with SDK files I stepped away from fiddling to deal with more pressing business.
<br> <br>
The next day I 3D printed a case for my pico so I could show off the kind of a computer smaller than my finger. It had a few problems because it was designed for the pico 1 but with a set of clippers in hand I resolved the issue. Once the weekend hit I had a lot more time. I learned how Cmake works and ended up following the C SDK documentation instead of the C quick start guide. After a little more adjusting compiler settings I finally got my light to blink!
<br> <br>
The next day (yesterday) I started to look at the pico W because I wanted to get the WIFI chip working which has brought me down a rabbit hole of sockets and other complexities I’m yet to grasp. I didn’t have much time today (I was barely able to write this post) but tomorrow I’ll take a closer look at sockets and actually watch one of the 45 minute tutorials I’ve been avoiding.
<br> <br>
Tomarrow I'll probably explain what I'm trying to buld and why I've taken such an interest in small power efficient computers.
<br> <br>
Good Luck!
