Wooo after two days of work I finally got my pico to output a VGA signal. I spent most of yesterday attaching resistors to my breadboard and have created some form of amalgamtion that can output a VGA signal.
Most of the time I spent doing this was spent learning CMake so I could figure out how to compile the example programs. I've learned a lot about CMake, linking libraries, and everything else. The next step is to build my To-Do list application.

The first step in setting everything up was wiring the electronics. I had to get a series of resistors attached to specific pins and connect them all together and then connect them to a pin in the VGA cable. After each one is connected I can power specific ones on and off to get an analog signal which is required for VGA input. I did that three times for red, green, and blue then I set up a single resistor between two sets of connections for syncing everything up.

Overall it was a good challenge and I've learned a lot. I'm glad to be getting back into the groove of learning and making this. The next step is actually finishing something.

woooo
