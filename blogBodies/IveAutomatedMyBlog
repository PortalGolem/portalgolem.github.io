Hello! Its certainly been a while but I'm back. I went on a vacation that lasted a few weeks and I'll be departing again in a few days but I've got a week of posts hopefully coming now that I've streamlined my process.
<br><br>
Today I made and finished up my automagick tool for creating blog posts. Now I just have to write a text file with the HTML body of my blog post and run a command in my console telling it the title, file path of my text file, and the path to my image file.
<br><br>
After the program gets that information it generates a new blogpost page based off of a template, copies the image into the directory for pictures in the website's file, and changes a bunch of things in a few templates based off of the information provided and the current date.
<br><br>
This program should make writing blog posts much simpler than what it was before. In still need to install the program properly. Currently the command to run the python file is quite long, I'd like to get it down to one command.
<br><br>
Overall I'm pretty happy with how the program turned out. This is the first post I'm using it for so hopefully it works.
<br><br><br>


Edit: Woo! It's working! This edit is testing the edit feature and if you see this then it's probably working. The edit feature works by not adding a new blog card to the main page and overwriting the old page file with a new shiny one.
