      <p>Hello there! Welcome to my blog! My goal is to write about something every day. Usually I’ll write about what I did but if I don't want to share that on a particular day I might try writing a short story, tutorial, or something like that. The intention of this blog is to get myself out of my comfort zone a little bit and set some expectations. I also wanted to keep a record of all the notable things I do so I thought a blog would be a fun opportunity. In addition I just started summer break so I’ve got a decent amount of time on my hands.
      <br><br>
This website is written exclusively in HTML and CSS. I might add some javascript elements at some point but for now I think this looks great. I wrote it over the course of the past two days. Yesterday I formatted the front page and today I’ve set up the blog section. The color scheme I pulled from https://coolors.co/. I’m taking pictures with an old samsung tablet I set to the lowes possible settings. It works well and I like the pictures. For some reason it goes all the way to 4k but I’m taking pictures in 720p.
<br><br>
I was trying to use an old camera my mom had but for some reason the pictures are all purple. I tried to open it up and fix it but two of the screws wouldn’t come out so I couldn't get all the pieces out. I think one of the parts is almost dead. 
<br><br>
One of my goals for the production of this blog is to automate the writing process. Currently I write the actual content in a google doc for the spell and grammar checks which is nice. After I finish this, copy my blog post template, copy the content of the google doc into the new html document,format some things like links and images and such, copy my card template onto the front page, add the image, title, and date to the card, copy that finished card into each applicable category, then push it to github to update the site. Among the things I would like to do to improve this process, automate the production of the card. And how it gets put into the list. Maybe I’ll write a command line tool for that. Then I want to automate the blog post formatting. I’ll probably just get neovim to do a spellcheck and hope I can catch any grammar issues myself. Then I could write directly in the HTML file.
<br><br>
Future posts will probably be a bit more focused than this one. It’s a bit all over the place because of the nature of it being my first one. I’ll probably post again today about my endeavor into embedded systems but I might wait until tomorrow. 
<br><br>
Good Luck!
