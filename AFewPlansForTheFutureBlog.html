      Hello there! I'm back from my week long trip and am excited to get doing some things. I plan on participating in the pirate software game jam because it happens to be coming up and I haven't done one in a while. Additionally I would like to get started with my to-do list project I had been planning on doing. 
<br><br>
I got some resistors which I can hopefully use to convert the digital signals from the pica to the analog signals required to use VGA ports. The only other thing I need to purchase is something to convert a 30 pin eDP port from the laptop screen to VGA. I had a 40 pin one for a different type of screen but I haven't found what I need just yet.

<br><br>
It has been a while since my last blog post and for this one I wanted to spell check for neovim working. After typing that last sentence I found a command that switches it on instantly. Apparently there was hardly any setup. To make it easier to use I'll add a keybind that toggles the spellcheck and then it'll all be set up.

<br><br>
I don't have many other particular plans just yet but hopefully I'll make something cool soon.

<br><br>
See ya tomorrow!
