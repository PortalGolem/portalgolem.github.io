      I was bored today and was completely lacking motivation. I've been considering starting a minecraft server but I couldn't come to any conclusion as to how I would get people to play who would stay active on the server. I haven't made progress on that front however It's 5:00 and I just installed unity. I'm not exactly motivated but writing this post right now is certainly helping with that.

My goal is to produce a game about traveling and exploring urban areas. It'll be pretty simple, mostly a sight seeing game, but I do want to include resource management and maybe some more skill based stuff. I needed something to do and I thought that this would be kind of fun. I've recently been doing alot more abstract stuff, excluding the tools that I've programmed for myself and I wanted to get back to actually programming and not worrying too much about the overhead like compiling and linking libraries and such that comes along with C programming.

This post was way shorter but I didn't really do much today so it makes sense.

something else, somewhat relevant to the last paragraph - I need to figure out how to limit my phone usage. An app called minimal phone, or something like that, was suggested to me but I need to do some research. If the way to unblock what I want to reach takes any less than half an hour of constantly actively doing something I will unlock it. I was able to get over youtube by forcing youtube to not save my watch history.
