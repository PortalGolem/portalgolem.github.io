			<h1>Hello there!</h1>
			<p>
				&emsp;Hello! I'm Andrew or PortalGolem depending on where you met me. I am a highschool student from Southern California. I am passionate about game development, Dungeons &#38; Dragons, and a whole lot more.
				It's nice to see you here on my humble corner of the web. I made this site to properly display all of my projects and ideas in order to show them off and get feedback. below I have a few cards of subjects I cover, projects I'm working on, and blog posts I've published.
				I try to post once a week in order to motivate me to make cool stuff. I might add a little box you can use to subscribe to my blog posts but for now just shoot an email to "portalgolemmail@gmail.com" and I'll send updates from there. Thanks for taking the time to look around!
